let and const - Block Scope -> Will be stored in 'separate memory' of block scope
var - Function Scope

if(true) {
    //Comound Statement - Group of statements
    let a = 10;
    console.log(a);
    
}

Where javascript expects single statements, there will provide group of statements
Block Scope - What are functions and variables accepts inside block as block scope
